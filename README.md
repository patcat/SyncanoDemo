Syncano Positive Affirmations
========

An app that demonstrates the user accounts, payment and text message capabilities of Syncano. It runs on Node and a very basic HTML/CSS/JS front end.

If you make something fantastic from Syncano after looking at this basic code, please do let me know! I'm on Twitter at @thatpatrickguy, or you can find me at http://www.patrickcatanzariti.com or http://www.patcat.com.

Keen for more of this sort of thing? This demo is part of an article at http://www.sitepoint.com.
